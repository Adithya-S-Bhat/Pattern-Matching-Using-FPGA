# Pattern-Matching-Using-FPGA

Pattern matching is the process of checking whether a specific sequence of characters/tokens/data exists among the given data.

# Functionally Similar to "grep" command

The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression. 

# FPGA

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices which is an array of logic gates, and this array can be programmed/configured in the field, i.e., by the user of the device as opposed to the people who designed it.

FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

# Regular Expression in the problem statement

(1|0)*1(1|0)[20]

# File Structure

-> Circuit Diagrams - Contains the circuit diagrams for various fundamental regex and for the given problem statement  
-> code - Conatins the verilog code  
-> examples - few exmaples solved in verilog  
-> CCBD_BootCamp - Presentation file  
-> FILE_DETAILS - Contains detail file structure  
-> Pattern-Matching - Contains Problem Statement  
-> regex-paper - Reference research paper    

# Steps to Execute

1. Navigate to the code folder
2. Execute command "make -f Makefile" in command prompt.
